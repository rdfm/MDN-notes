# Combinators and selector lists

see [How to apply multiple selectors to the same rule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Introduction_to_CSS/Combinators_and_multiple_selectors)

## Combinators

- CSS has several ways to select elements based on how they are related to one another.
- Expressed as "combinators"

*NOTE*: (A and B represent any selector)

- **Selector list**:  A, B
  - Any element matching A and/or B
  - *NOTE* Group of Selectors **NOT** considered to be a combinator
- **Descendant combinator**:  A B
  - Any element matching B that is a descendant of an element matching A (a child, or a child of a child, etc.)
  - *NOTE*: Combinator is one or more spaces or dual greater than signs
- **Child combinator**: A > B
  - Any element matching B that is a direct child of an element matching A
- **Adjacent sibling combinator**: A + B
  - Any element matching B that is the next sibling of an element matching A (next child of the same parent)
- **General sibling combinator**: A ~ B
  - Any element matching B that is one of the next siblings of an element matching A (one of the next children of the same parent)

### Combinators example

**HTML**:

```html
<table lang="en-US" class="with-currency">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Product</th>
      <th scope="col">Qty</th>
      <th scope="col">Price</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tfoot>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2" scope="row">Total:</th>
      <td>148.55</td>
    </tr>
  </tfoot>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Lawnchair</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>137.00</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Marshmallow rice bar</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>1.10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Book</td>
      <td>1</td>
      <td>10.45</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
```

**CSS**:

```css
/* Basic table setup */
table {
  font: 1em sans-serif;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  border-spacing: 0;
}

/* All <td>s within a <table> and all <th>s within a <table>
   Comma is not a combinator, it just allows you to target
   several selectors with the same CSS ruleset */
table td, table th {
  border: 1px solid black;
  padding: 0.5em 0.5em 0.4em;
}

/* All <th>s within <thead>s that are within <table>s */
table thead th {
  color: white;
  background: black;
}

/* All <td>s preceded by another <td>,
   within a <tbody>, within a <table> */
table tbody td + td {
  text-align: center;
}

/* All <td>s that are a last child,
   within a <tbody>, within a <table> */
table tbody td:last-child {
  text-align: right;
}

/* All <th>s, within a <tfoot>s, within a <table> */
table tfoot th {
  text-align: right;
  border-top-width: 5px;
  border-left: none;
  border-bottom: none;
}

/* All <td>s preceded by a <th>, within a <table> */
table th + td {
  text-align: right;
  border-top-width: 5px;
  color: white;
  background: black;
}

/* All pseudo-elements "before" <td>s that are a last child,
   appearing within elements with a class of "with-currency" that
   also have an attribute "lang" with the value "en-US" */
.with-currency[lang="en-US"] td:last-child::before {
  content: '$';
}

/* All pseudo-elements "after" <td>s that are a last child,
   appearing within elements with the class "with-currency" that
   also have an attribute "lang" with the value "fr" */
.with-currency[lang="fr"] td:last-child::after {
  content: ' â‚¬';
}
```

## Groups of selectors on one rule

- groups of selectors separated by commas to apply the same rule to multiple sets of selected elements at once

**EXAMPLES (CSS)**:

```css
p, li {
  font-size: 1.6em;
}

OR

h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 {
  font-family: helvetica, 'sans serif';
}
```

**IMPORTANT**:  If a single selector is not supported by the browser, then the whole selector list gets ignored (i.e. :is() pseudo-class)
