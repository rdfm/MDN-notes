### Types of links

**Internal link**:

- a link between two webpages
- where webpages belong to same website
- thus term "website" (unless single page website)

**External links**:

- a link from website to external webpage
- Web is a network of webpages
- use to provide info

**Incoming links**:

- a link from external webpage to your site
- opposite of an external link
- *Note*: Not required to link back

- link pointing to an anchor
- browsers jumps to another part of the current document
  - instead of loading a new document
- made same way as links

### Links and Search Engines

- links matter to users and search engines

> Every time search engines crawl a webpage, they index the website by following the links available on the webpage. Search engines not only follow links to discover the various pages of the website, but they also use the link's visible text to determine which search queries are appropriate for reaching the target webpage.

**NOTE**: Known about how search engines determine a site's rank

- A link's visible text influences which search queries will find a given URL.
- The more incoming links a webpage can boast of, the higher it ranks in search results.
- External links influence the search ranking both of source and target webpages, but it is unclear by how much.
