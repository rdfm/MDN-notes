## SFTP

Filezilla

### Uploading to the server

### Are they really online?

## Rsync

- local-to-remote file synchronizing tool
- generally available on most unix-based systems (macOS, Linux)
- way to synchronize files between servers or to simply move files between servers without the need of FTP
- connects two servers via the SSH protocol, allowing for the transfer of data between them


Example: 

```
rsync [-options] SOURCE user@x.x.x.x:DESTINATION
```
