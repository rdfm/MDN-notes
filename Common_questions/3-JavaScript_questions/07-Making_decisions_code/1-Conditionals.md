# Making decisions in your code â€” conditionals

see [How do you execute different blocks of code, depending on a variable's value or other condition?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/conditionals)

> code needs to make decisions and carry out actions accordingly depending on different inputs

**EXAMPLES**:

- In a game, if the player's number of lives is 0, then it's game over
- In a weather app, if it is being looked at in the morning, show a sunrise graphic; show stars and a moon if it is nighttime.

## Conditional statements

> Conditional statements allow us to represent such decision making in JavaScript, from the choice that must be made to the resulting outcome of those choices.
