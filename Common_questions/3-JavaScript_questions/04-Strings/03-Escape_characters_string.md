# Escaping characters in a string

see [How do you escape characters in strings?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings#Escaping_characters_in_a_string)

> Escaping characters means that we do something to them to make sure they are recognized as text, not part of the code. In JavaScript, we do this by putting a backslash just before the character.

**EXAMPLE**:

```javascript
var bigmouth = 'I\'ve got no right to take my place...';
bigmouth;
```
