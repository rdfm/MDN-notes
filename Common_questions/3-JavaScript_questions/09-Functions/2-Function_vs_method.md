# Functions versus methods

see [What is the difference between a function and a method?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions#Functions_versus_methods)

- technically speaking, built in browser functions are NOT functions â€” they are **methods**
- methods are functions defined inside objects. Built-in browser functions (methods) and variables (which are called **properties**) are stored inside structured objects, to make the code more efficient and easier to handle
