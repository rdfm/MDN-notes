# Types of error

see [What are the basic types of error?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_went_wrong#Types_of_error)

- Two main types of errors:

## Syntax errors

- spelling errors in your code 
- cause the program not to run at all, or stop working part way through
- usually be provided with some error messages
- usually okay to fix
  - familiarize with the right tools
  - know what the error messages mean

## Logic errors

- errors where the syntax is actually correct but the code is not what you intended it to be
- program runs successfully but gives incorrect results.
- often harder to fix
  - usually isn't a resulting error message to direct you to the source of the error
