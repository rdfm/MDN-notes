# Arithmetic operators

see [How do you do basic math in JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Math#Arithmetic_operators)

## +

> Addition

- Adds two numbers together.
  - Example:  6 + 9

## -

> Subtraction

- Subtracts the right number from the left.
  - Example: 20 - 15

## *

> Multiplication

- Multiplies two numbers together.
  - Example: 3 * 7

## /

> Division

- Divides the left number by the right.
  - Example: 10 / 5

## %

> Remainder (sometimes called modulo)

- Returns the remainder left over after you've divided the left number into a number of integer portions equal to the right number.
  - Example: 8 % 3 (returns 2, as three goes into 8 twice, leaving 2 left over).

## **

> Exponent

- Raises a base number to the exponent power, i.e. the number of base numbers specified by the exponent are all multiplied together.
  - Example: 5 ** 5 (returns 3125, which is the same as 5 * 5 * 5 * 5 * 5).

*NOTE*: Sometimes see numbers involved in sums referred to as operands.

*NOTE*: Sometimes see exponents expressed using the older Math.pow() method. Example, in Math.pow(7, 3), 7 = base, 3 = exponent, thurs, result = 343. Math.pow(7, 3) == 7**3.
