# Declaring a variable

see [How do you declare a variable?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#Declaring_a_variable)

- create the variable aka "declaring the variable"
- type keyword **var** or **let** followed by the name

```javascript
let myName;
let myAge;
```

*NOTE*: In JavaScript, all code instructions should end with a semi-colon (;)

**TEST (In terminal)**:

```javascript
myName  // undefined
myAge   // undefined
```

**WARNING**: **DO NOT** confuse a variable that exists but has no value defined with a variable that doesn't exist at all
