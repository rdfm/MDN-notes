# JavaScript: Basic Definitions

see [Basic definitions](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Howto#Basic_definitions)

## [What is JavaScript?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/What_is_JavaScript#A_high-level_definition)

**JavaScript** =

- a scripting or programming language
- allows you to implement complex things on web pages
- Examples:
  - displaying timely content updates
  - interactive maps
  - animated 2D/3D graphics
  - scrolling video jukeboxes, etc.
- The third layer of the layer cake of standard web technologies, in addition to HTML and CSS

## [What is a variable?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Variables#What_is_a_variable)

**variable** = a container for a value (i.e. number, string, complex data, functions, etc.)

## [What are strings?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Strings)

**string** = piece of text in programming

## [What is an array?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/First_steps/Arrays#What_is_an_Array)

**array** =

- storing a list of data items under a single variable name
- described as "list-like objects"
- single object that contains/stores multiple values

## [What is a loop?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Looping_code)

**loop** = aka *iteration*, doing the same thing over and over again.

## [What is a function?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Functions)

**functions** = reusable blocks of code

- allow to store a piece of code that does a single task inside a defined block
- then call the code whenever needed, using a single short command
- rather than having to typeout same code multiple times

## [What is an event?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Events)

**event** = 

- actions or occurrences that happen in the system you are programming
- system will fire a signal of some kind when an event occurs
- and also provide a mechanism by which some kind of action can be automatically taken (e.g. some code running) when the event occurs
- Example: if the user clicks a button on a webpage, respond to that action by displaying an information box

## [What is an object?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Basics#Object_basics)

**object** =

- a collection of related data and/or functionality
- consists of several variables and functions
- which are called properties and methods when they are inside objects

## [What is JSON?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/JSON#No_really_what_is_JSON)

**JSON** = JavaScript Object Notation

- a text-based data format following JavaScript object syntax
- popularized by Douglas Crockford
- closely resembles JavaScript object literal syntax, - can be used independently from JavaScript
- JSON exists as a string, useful to transmit data across a network
- convert to a native JavaScript object when need to access the data
-JavaScript provides a global JSON object that has methods available for converting between the two

**NOTE**:

- *parsing* = convert a string to a native object
- *stringification* = convert a native object to a string (so it can be transmitted across the network)

## [What is a web API?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction#What_are_APIs)

**API** = Application Programming Interface

- constructs made available in programming languages to allow developers to create complex functionality more easily
- abstract more complex code away from you, providing some easier syntax to use in its place
- Example (real-world): Plug socket and electricity supply.

## [What is the DOM?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Manipulating_documents#The_document_object_model)

**DOM** = Document Object Model

- a "tree structure" representation created by the browser that enables the HTML structure to be easily accessed by programming languages
