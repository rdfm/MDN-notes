# The box model

- each element is represented as a rectangular box
- box's layers (built up)
  - content
  - padding
  - border
  - margin
- As a browser renders a web page layout, works out:
  - what styles are applied to the content of each box
  - how big the surrounding layers are
  - where the boxes sit in relation to one another
