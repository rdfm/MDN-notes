# Introduction to the server side

see[Introduction to the server side](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/First_steps/Introduction)

> Most large-scale websites use server-side code to dynamically display different data when needed, generally pulled out of a database stored on a server and sent to the client to be displayed via some code (e.g. HTML and JavaScript).

## What is server-side website programming?

**HTTP**: HyperText Transfer Protocol

- web browsers communicate with web servers using HTTP
- *HTTP Request*, sent from browser to the server, when:
  - click a link
  - submit a form
  - run a search

**HTTP Request**, includes:

- URL identifying the affected resource
- method that defines the required action (ex. to get, delete, or post the resource)
- may include additional information encoded in URL parameters (the field-value pairs sent via a query string), as POST data (data sent by the HTTP POST method), or in associated cookies.

**HTTP Response**:

- Web servers wait for client request messages, process them when they arrive, and reply to the web browser with an HTTP response message.
- The response contains a status line indicating whether or not the request succeeded (e.g. "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" for success)
